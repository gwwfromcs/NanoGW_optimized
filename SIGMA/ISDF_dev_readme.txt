For current implementation of ISDF method, I assume all the pair products of wave functions required for 
SIGMA calculation has already been included in TDLDA calculations.
In other words, all the pair products of wave functions used in SIGMA calculations are 
defined in [v,c]=[pol_in%vmap(:),pol_in%cmap(:)].
